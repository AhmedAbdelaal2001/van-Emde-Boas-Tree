## Speeding Up Queries Exponentially
Our goal is to implement a tree data structure that is exponentially faster than Balanced Binary Search Trees, while having "cooler" queries than hashing. A van Emde
Boas Tree is a recursvie data structure capable of insert, delete, find, successor, predecessor, max and min queries in at most O(log(log(n))) time.
